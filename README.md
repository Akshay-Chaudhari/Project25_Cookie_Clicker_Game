# Project25_Cookie_Clicker_Game
This is a Cookie Clicker game where we have to increase the prouction of the cookies by the various means.
Cookie Clicker is a 2013 incremental game created by French programmer Julien "Orteil" Thiennot. 
The user initially clicks on a big cookie on the screen, earning a single cookie per click. 
They can then use their earned cookies to purchase assets such as "cursors" and other "buildings" that automatically produce cookies. 
Upgrades are also available and can improve the efficiency of clicks and buildings, among many other mechanics that allow the user to earn cookies in different ways.
